      <h3>I am a budding software developer currently training at Code Fellows.</h3>
      <p>
        I have been teaching myself to code off and on for about five years prior to attending Code Fellows. 
        Up until now it has always been something which I was able to devote a hobby amount of time on, 
        but for which I had a passion to learn the craft. 
        I am excited to finally be able to engage with coding in an immersive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have many diverse interests, but one which intersects quite strongly with software development is finance. 
        Some of my early personal projects involved implementing automated trading and arbitrage strategies. I would
        start by finding a project on github which had some functionality which vaguely resembled what I wanted to
        accomplish. I would then start going through the source code, knowing what the code was supposed to do, trying
        to figure out why all these different functions were needed to accomplish the desired result. Then I would start 
        playing with the code, making incremental changes to better understand how it worked. After I understood the 
        code, I could completely rip it apart, saving the bits I needed, and then start coding my own logic into this 
        skeleton of functionality. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This generally involved simultaneously learning crash-course style the built-in functions and syntax of a new
        programming language. I learned to work with C#, C++, and Python this way. Python quickly became my favorite.
        If this all sounds terribly difficult and exhausting, it <em>was!</em> I would build out a working concept, fine 
        tune it for a week or two, and then not code anything for several months. The cumulative frustration of having to
        find answers to every question myself, (and sometimes not even knowing the right question to ask), would just burn 
        out. Well, that, and I'd find another one of my interests to obsess over for a few weeks.

      <h3>Well, I've been around a bit.</h3>
      <p>
        I was an intelligent kid but I didn't like school much. So, even though aced most 
        tests, I was failing most of my classes through high school, because I never turned in a scrap of homework! On 
        my 18th birthday, I was an 18 year old 11th grader with a 1.9 GPA, and I promptly followed my dad's advice of 
        "If you won't take this seriously, you might as well just go get a damn job instead!" and unenrolled myself from 
        ahigh school. 
        Two months a US Army recruiter passed me his card across the counter at a popular fried chicken chain which was my 
        full-time employment. It seemed like it would be a much less boring job, but a GED was required at least, and 
        a HS diploma for most specialties. I enrolled in a correspondence program with proctored testing, and through 
        self-directed study, earned 2 years worth of High School credits in just under 2 months, -enough for my diploma. 
        I entered the Army and became a medic, serving multiple tours in Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my military time I've drifted from job to job, and attended a few trade schools, always seeking opportunities
        to learn how to do something I thought was interesting. The problem I've always found is that with most jobs, the 
        learning curve flattens out after 3-6 months and the job becomes repetetive and boring, or the opportunities to learn 
        further are contingent on advancement into occupied positions that are not likely to become vacant. So, I frequently
        quit jobs, and sometimes pack up and move to a whole new state, just to try something new.

      <h3>I think that in software development, I've finally found a bottomless well to satiate my neverending curiosity.</h3>
      <p>
        It's not just about feeding my desire to learn however. Software has the power to fundamentally alter and enhance the 
        way we interact as a society. Software and interconnectivity has already turned entire intustries on end, and has 
        sent countless technologies, processes, and even beaurocracies to obsoletion. I want to be able to contribute to this 
        change in a positive way.
